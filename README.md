# 1course_asm_c_project
Developed a project that calculates the area of the figure bounded by three arbitrary curves, the equations of which are given at the stage of Assembly of the program. Two programs in C had to be developed. The main - to find the intersection points of curves in several ways and calculate the area. And auxiliary - to build code that calculates the values of functions.
